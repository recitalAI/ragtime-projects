# Presentation
The `ragtime-projects` repo contains projects built using **Ragtime** ðŸŽ¹.

# Getting started
## Install the package
Make sure you have already installed the Ragtime ðŸŽ¹ package. If not, just run:
```shell
pip install ragtime
```

If you want to modify the `ragtime-package` then you will want to install it as an editable version. In this case, go to the base folder of `ragtime-package` and run in the shell:
```
pip install -e .
```
(don't forget the last dot).
If you have an error `(A "pyproject.toml" file was found, but editable mode currently requires a setup.py based build.)`, upgrade `pip`.

## Create your project
Edit `PROJECT_NAME` in the `main.py` file and run it.

This will create a subfolder named according to `PROJECT_NAME` containing:
- folder `expe`: contains 4 sub-folders containing the data which will be created at each step of your experiments
- folder `logs`: the logs associated with your project
- folder `res`: contains templates for the file exports
- `classes.py`: your classes to define the Prompter and Retrievers you may use
- `main.py`: the file containing the `main` function for your project
- `LICENSE`: MIT by default - don't forget to add you name / company in it
- `README.md`: your project's doc
- `.gitignore`

*At this point, don't forget to set `PROJECT_NAME` in the `main.py` in your project folder.*
